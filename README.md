# Contribution Guide

To contribute to this site, you will first need to install **Hugo** and **git**. You will also need to set up a sub-module so that the local directory containing the Hugo site files would point to two places:

1. `site` - the full directory containing the actual site files. 
2. `hong-kong-districts-info.github.io` - the sub-directory called `public`, which points to https://github.com/Hong-Kong-Districts-Info/hong-kong-districts-info.github.io. This sub-directory contains the static HTML files generated by Hugo.
