### Background

In the open-source community, sample datasets play an important role for the democratisation of data skills. If not for the accessibility of classic datasets such as **iris**, **mtcars**, and **Titanic**, students of data analysis and data science would have to face one additional barrier to learning. It is not easy to get hold of data that satsifies all the conditions of being (i) interesting, (ii) relevant to the audience, and (iii) free to share publicly.

We noticed that there is a lack of such datasets for those who are interested in practising their data skills on a theme that is meaningful and relevant to them, namely Hong Kong. 

For this project, we created an R package to **make it easy to practise analysis and visualisation** with datasets which are related to Hong Kong.
