## Vision Statement

Our vision of **Hong Kong Districts Info** is to establish a learning and collaboration community to bring together people who are interested in:

  1. Learning and developing new skills, and 
  1. Want real, impactful projects to work on

Hong Kong Districts Info provides for such an environment where aspiring developers, artists, content creators, etc. can collaborate on Hong Kong district themed projects to establish their portfolio, promote their work, collaborate on open-source projects and make a positive impact. 

As the founders of this platform, we would participate in certain projects ourselves, but would also help connect and coordinate individuals so they can collaborate and publish work under our platform. 

If you are someone who is looking to build and expand their first coding, design, data science project, or website/app portfolio, and if you are looking to practice your skills on a meaningful, open-source project, you have come to the right place. From our base, we hope to provide mentoring to those who do not have the skills, but want to learn them.

> 一個提供學習與合作的平台，集合有興趣於：1）學習或發展新技能，以及 2）開展切實有效的項目的人仕。

## 願景聲明

Hong Kong Districts Info（下稱HKDI）的願景是建立一個提供學習與協作的團體，將對以下方面感興趣的人們集合在一起：

1. 學習和發展新技能，以及
2. 開展切實有效的項目

HKDI提供一個平台，使有抱負的程式開發員、藝術家、內容創作者等等，都可以在香港十八區地區主題項目上進行合作，以建立其作品集，推廣其作品，在開放原始碼項目上合作並帶來正面的影響。

作為此平台的創建者，我們將繼續參與一些自行開展的項目，同時也會幫助聯繫和協調有興趣加入者，以便他們可以在我們的平台下進行協作和發布作品。

如果您們的編碼、設計、數據科學項目或網站/應用程序作品集正尋求構建或擴展，並且希望在有意義的開放原始碼項目中練習技能，那麼您來了一個正確的地方。在此團體，我們希望可以提供指導給那些沒有技能但想學習的人仕。
